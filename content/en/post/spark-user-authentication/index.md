 Solving the Kerberos User Authentication Issue in Spark Docker Streaming

While building my real-time streaming pipeline using Spark, Kafka, and Docker, I ran into a **Spark error** related to Kerberos authentication - when I wasn't even using Kerberosa. 

```bash
org.apache.hadoop.security.KerberosAuthException: failure to login: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: java.lang.NullPointerException: invalid null input: name
```

## ‚ùì What triggered the problem?

* I was using the official apache/spark:3.5.0 Docker image.
* Spark inside Docker was trying to resolve Hadoop's default authentication mechanism.
* Hadoop tries to retrieve the current OS user via:

```java
UnixPrincipal(name)
```
* Inside Docker containers, my app was running as UID/GID that **had no proper username mapping**.
* This caused:
```bash
invalid null input: name
```
because UnixPrincipal() received null.

## üîé Root Cause

* Spark uses Hadoop's UserGroupInformation internally.
* Hadoop falls back to the system user if no explicit user is configured.
* But Docker containers don't always have valid /etc/passwd entries for dynamically assigned users.
* No valid username ‚Üí Hadoop crashes ‚Üí Kerberos exception.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This issue happens even if you're not using Kerberos! The exception name is misleading ‚Äî it's simply Hadoop not finding the current user.

## üîß The Fix: Set Valid Username Inside Docker

Instead of patching Spark or Hadoop config, I solved this cleanly by:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Explicitly creating a valid user inside the Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
FROM apache/spark:3.5.0
USER root
# Create airflow user (or any valid user)
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash airflow
USER airflow
WORKDIR /opt/spark-app
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Set HOME environment variable in docker-compose.yml**
```yaml
environment:
  - HOME=/home/airflow
  - HADOOP_USER_NAME=airflow
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£** ‚úÖ Now Hadoop's UserGroupInformation can successfully resolve user identity inside the container.

## üî¨ Why this fix works

* Hadoop doesn't care about UID or GID.
* It only needs a valid username string.
* Creating a named user inside Docker satisfies this requirement.
* No need to configure full Kerberos, Kinit, or any secure ticket infrastructure.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

* Hadoop inside Spark relies on valid OS users.
* Docker sometimes creates anonymous UIDs ‚Üí always explicitly create users.
* Set HOME and HADOOP_USER_NAME to match.
* Avoid wildcard SPARK_CLASSPATH=* style configs ‚Äî prefer explicit JAR mounting.
* Debug systematically: read logs top-down. The root cause is usually much earlier than you think.

This tiny Dockerfile tweak saved me hours of painful debugging.
