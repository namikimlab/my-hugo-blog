In real-world data engineering pipelines, one of the most common mistakes is **postponing data cleansing until too late in the pipeline.**  

The cleaner your upstream data is, the simpler and more maintainable your downstream models will be.  

Let’s break it down.

## ✅ The Principle

Whenever possible, cleanse your data **as early as possible** — ideally at the **staging layer**.


## ✅ The Why

### 1️⃣ Clear Separation of Responsibilities

- **Staging models** are responsible for:
  - Cleaning
  - Normalizing
  - Type casting

- If you push dirty data all the way down to your marts (such as `dim_customer`, `fct_transaction`), you will create:

  - Complex downstream models  
  - Repeated filters  
  - Fragile, hard-to-maintain code

### 2️⃣ The Marts Layer Should Only Handle Business Logic

- Marts layer should focus purely on:
  - Joins
  - Aggregations
  - Dimension relationships

- Cleaning, null handling, and standardization **should already be done** upstream.
- This leads to much cleaner and more readable SQL.

### 3️⃣ This Is How Real Systems Are Designed

**Pipeline flow:**

source → staging (cleansing, standardization) → marts (modeling, aggregations)



## ✅ Summary Table

| Layer  | Role                          | Cleansing?          |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Staging | Clean, normalize, type cast     | ✅ Mandatory |
| Marts  | Joins, aggregations, business logic | ❌ Should receive clean data |



## ✅ Practical Implementation Rules

At staging layer, apply:

- Convert dirty strings (`'NaN'`, empty strings, extreme values) → `NULL`
- Drop rows with missing **primary keys** (e.g. `cardholder_id IS NULL`)
- Allow non-key columns (e.g. `description`) to remain `NULL` — downstream can safely process them



## 🔥 How to Say This in a Real Interview or Portfolio:

> "We standardized dirty strings at the staging layer, ensuring that marts always consume clean data. This simplifies downstream joins and aggregations, greatly improving stability and maintainability."
